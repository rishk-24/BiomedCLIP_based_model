# BiomedCLIP_based_model

BiomedCLIP is a biomedical vision-language foundation model that is pretrained on PMC-15M, a dataset of 15 million figure-caption pairs extracted from biomedical research articles in PubMed Central, using contrastive learning. It uses PubMedBERT as the text encoder and Vision Transformer as the image encoder, with domain-specific adaptations. It can perform various vision-language processing (VLP) tasks such as cross-modal retrieval, image classification, and visual question answering.

      Problem Statement: -
The problem statement of a prompt-based image-to-caption generator refers to the task of generating textual captions or descriptions for images based on given prompts. It involves developing an automated system that can understand the content of an image and generate relevant captions based on the provided captions and prompts.

Developing image-to-caption generators models require images paired with captions and prompts generated by us for training and evaluation. The model learns the correlation between visual and textual information and generate captions that accurately describe the visual content of the images based on the provides prompts.
Prompt-based image-caption generation in the medical domain can be applied in various ways to assist healthcare professionals, improve medical education, and enhance patient care.

Medical Image Analysis and Interpretation: 
Prompt-based image-caption generation can help healthcare professionals in understanding and interpreting medical images. By providing a prompt related to the desired information or specific features of interest in the image, the model can generate descriptive captions that highlight those aspects. This can aid in the diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of patients. 
For instance, consider an MRI brain scan. A radiologist may require a textual description that includes specific details, such as the presence of abnormalities or the location of a tumor. By providing a prompt like “Identify any abnormality in the frontal lobe”, the image-to-caption generator can produce a descriptive caption based on the given prompt.
This project focuses on developing an image captioning system that utilizes both textual information related to the image and a prompt to generate descriptive captions.
At training time-   Input – Images, Captions, and Prompts
At Inference time – Input – Prompts and Images, Output – Captions based on prompts and images

These are the following setups requires to the model to work: -
Training Data: The training data for this project consists of pairs of images and their corresponding captions or descriptions. Each caption provides a textual representation of the content present in the image. The dataset also includes prompt-text pairs, where prompts serve as guiding instructions or queries related to the image.
Training Process:
1.	The model is trained using the image-caption pairs as the primary training data. The model learns to associate visual features extracted from the images with their corresponding captions.
2.	Simultaneously, the model is also trained to understand the relationships between the prompt and the image-captions pairs. The prompts help guide the model’s understanding of what information to focus on or what aspect of the image to describe.

Inference Process: During the inference phase, the trained model takes both a prompt and an image as input to generate a caption.
1.	The image is processed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract meaningful visual features. These features capture the important aspects of the image.
2.	The prompt is encoded to represent its contextual information. This encoding allows the model to understand the desired focus or guidance provided by the prompt.
3.	The encoded prompt and the extracted visual features are combined and used as input to the model’s caption generation component.
4.	The model then generates a caption by predicting one word at a time, considering both the visual information from the image and the contextual information from the prompt.
5.	The caption is generated word by word until an end token is predicted or a maximum caption length is reached.
